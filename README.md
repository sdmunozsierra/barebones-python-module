Barebones python3 module with testing and logging environment

## Environment
This repo contains the environment to start coding with an enabled App module (main program), a Logger (logging capabilities), and Tests (using pytest). It has been set up so modules can be imported from anywhere without braking the application.

## Settings
Global settings should be configured in `module_config.py` as it is on the root directory.
